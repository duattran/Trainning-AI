[ Tip and Tricks list]
Here is an exhaustive, that you could use to boost your model performance
Data Labeling 
• Use representative data for each class 
• Avoid adding low-quality data 
• Small dataset size for pre-trained models 
• Bigger dataset size when training from scratch 
• Identify and fix incorrect classes 
• Balance your data distribution 
• Use Soft-Labeling: Labeling using pre-trained models (free labeled data) 
• Use Self-Training: Labeling using the model you are training (free labeled data) 
• Add hard examples: images your model is struggling to detect target objects

Image Size 
• Use the highest image resolution your GPU can afford. 
• Use progressive resizing: Train with small-size images, and gradually increase the size 
• Use tiling: Train using image patches 
• Use the image size recommended by the model

Anchor-Boxes 
• Use anchor boxes with a size/ratio close to target boxes 
• Use auto-anchoring: search for the best anchors 
• Use some anchor-free object detection models

Data Augmentation (DA) 
• Oversample images with small boxes 
• Use transforms close to your use case 
• Use Copy & Paste / Mosaic DA 
• Use Mosaic DA 
• Use heavy DA at the beginning of training 
• Use light DA at the end of the training 
• Use synthetic data

Modeling 
• Use larger models: they outperform smaller ones 
• Use smaller models when training small dataset 
• Use Focal Loss for the classification head 
• Use GIoU Loss for the regression head (box location)

Training 
• Train from scratch if data is different than the COCO dataset 
• Freeze the whole/part of the backbone 
• Use suggested LR 
• Increase LR when using multiple GPU 
• Use the discriminative learning rate technique 
• Decrease batch size if the loss plateaus 
• Decrease LR if the loss plateaus 
• Train as long as your validation loss is decreasing 
• Add more data, and data augmentation when overfitting

Inference 
• Put the model on evaluation mode 
• Use the same image size as in the training phase 
• With high-resolution images, apply inference on patches/slices like in the SAHI library
